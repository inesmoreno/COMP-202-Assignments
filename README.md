COMP 202: Foundations of programming

Excerpts from the assignments' instructions: 

Mexico.java
Mexico is an elimination dice game. At the start of the game, all players accept to gamble a fixed amount of money and, at the end of each round, the player with the lowest score puts a predetermined portion of that money into the pot.The game ends when enough rounds have been played that only one player with any money remains, at which point the pot is his. The goal of this question is to write several methods in order to create a program that simulates two players, Giulia and David, playing a game of Mexico.

TicTacToe.java
This assignment should be solved without the use of OOP concepts. For this question, you will write a program called TicTacToe that allows a user to play Tic Tac Toe against an AI (the computer).  You can assume that the user plays using the symbol 'x', while the AI uses the symbol 'o'.

BookingSystem
For this question,  you will write several classes (Room, Reservation, Hotel),  and then create and use instances of those classes inorder to simulate a hotel booking system. [BookingSystem.java was provided, only had to write the main method]

Twitter
For  this  question,  you  will  write  two  classes  to  create  a  new  data  type  that  will  model  information extracted from twitter.
